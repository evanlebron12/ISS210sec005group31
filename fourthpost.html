                        <p>Systemic racism is defined as repetitive actions that display discrimination popping up in the educational, economic, and criminal justice systems. It’s nothing new to America and has plagued the United States since its conception. Not to mention, the effects of systemic racism cannot be understated.</p>
                        <p>Interpersonal racism is oftentimes targeted and usually affects the one individual who is involved. We have all seen this many times and there are thousands of examples of such a thing taking place. A microaggression is just one example of something like this occurring. These types of occurrences can be extremely damaging to oneself. And there is no telling what something like this could do to the mental health of a victim. However in this section, I would like to focus on something that isn’t addressed as much as it needs to be. I would never want to discount the negative impact that interpersonal racism has, but there’s only so much we can do to stop it from occurring. But by addressing how the institution is failing and taking a stand against it, we might not see such an inconceivable amount of those impacted by racism and the mental health issues that come along with it.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Why Racism and Mental Health Are Interconnected</h2>
                        <p>Systemic racism has brought many issues with it, but a key one happens to be economic inequality. Economic inequality has caused depression for thousands of families in the U.S. and around the globe. That income gap also has major implications on access to resources. If people can’t seek out the proper help that they need, then how do we expect this issue to stop anytime soon. And the list of mental health issues that this can cause isn’t limited either. PTSD, depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and substance abuse orders have all been linked to systemic racism. </p>
                        <p>I could go on and on about the variety of issues that minorities face on a daily basis because of systemic racism. But at the end of the day, no matter how serious it is, any type of racism can be extremely detrimental to the mental health of the victim.</p>
